Yui but in TypeScript

**Rewrite version of YuiJS**

**WORK IN PROGRESS!**

> **How to use ?**

 - Create a `.env` file with: 
   - `TOKEN` is your bot token
   - A fixed `PREFIX`
   - Your own `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` which you can get from Google APIs Console
   - You will also need your bot id to replace `YUI_ID`  and your own id to replace `OWNER_ID`
   - Also a `TENOR_KEY` which you can get from Tenor API and a `TENOR_ANONYMOUS_ID`.

> **How to run ?**
 - First you need to install the libraries:
   - On Windows: You will need to install Python 2.7, Microsoft Visual Studio (Community) with C++ compiler and language support installed. About which option: sorry i forgot, you will need to figure it out yourself, but it takes about 6-8 something GB of memory iirc. And then `npm install`
   - Also on Windows: Enable your Windows Linux Subsystem and do the same as on Linux.
   - On Linux: (I use Ubuntu) Just `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`. Then install Python 2.7, and then `npm install`.
 - If nothing happen then your good to run, or else google for the error XD.
 - If you need to use other node version, consider installing `nvm` so that you can switch node versions.
